We'll be using OpenAI, Mirascope, and Lilypad for this workshop.

Complete the [Lilypad Quickstart Guide](https://lilypad.so/docs/quickstart) first if you would like to follow along, which will ensure you have a Lilypad account as well as all the necessary packages installed.

## 1. Understanding LLM API fundamentals

- The LLM API call is the fundamental building block
    - Everything builds on top of this primitive
    - All frameworks and tools ultimately make these calls
- Engineers must understand their building blocks
    - Canâ€™t build effectively without know how pieces work
    - Debugging requires understand these basics
- How we structure our code is extremely important
    - Need a solid foundation to build robust systems
